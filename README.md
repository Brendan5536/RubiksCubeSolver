# RubiksCubeSolver
Creating a Rubik's Cube Solver written in C#. This project will create a limited database, but the code will be easily scalable to cover all the cube's combinations given a powerful enough computer.

# Instructions to Run
You'll need a laptop, (one not linked to Culver's system, as it blocks 'unsigned code' from being run), the most recent version of Visual Studio Code, and the Microsoft C# extension.
Download the files, open the "Program.cs" file, and type "dotnet run" into the terminal.
