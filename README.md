# RubiksCubeSolver
Creating a Rubik's Cube Solver written in C#. This project consists of a limited database, but the code is scalable to cover all the cube's combinations, given a powerful computer/server.

# Instructions to Run
You'll need a laptop, (one not linked to Culver's system, as it blocks 'unsigned code' from being run), the most recent version of Visual Studio Code, and the Microsoft C# extension.
Download the files, and open the "Program.cs" file in VS Code. For the program to output properly, two identical filepath names need to be changed to a local filepath. Once the line is changed, and the file is saved, type "dotnet run" into the terminal, and the program will run.
